Donate plugin for Shopware 6

Selected products can be marked as donation products, a percentage is entered here in the plugin configuration, which, based on the net price of the products in the shopping cart, includes the donation value as a separate item in the shopping cart. This cannot be removed by the customer. This value is added to the shopping cart as a tax-free item (0% tax rate).

This donation item can then be seen on all other documents and, like items in the orders, can also be subsequently edited by the admin.

Configuration:



The plugin creates a new configuration field in the article details with the name "donation product".


Variant articles are recorded uniformly, which means that if the article is declared as a donation article, the associated variants are also recorded as a donation.

## Install:

Upload and Install via Plugin Manager
